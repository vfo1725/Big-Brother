like Season 13, had a mix of veterans and newbies. One of the four
veterans to return was Dan Gheesling, and he pulled off what is argued
to be the best move in Big Brother history. This move had Dan act out a
funeral after he was certain to go home, but the funeral won the
sympathy of everyone in the house and he satyed. Dan made it to the

Hitmen", and controlled the whole game, being one of only two Final Two

the twin twist, in which two identical housguest twins would secretly
switch in and out of the house until the jury started. After this, Liz

winner, is known to have been the biggest floater to win Big Brother,

eviction and all of the other houseguests did what he wanted. Paul,
however, lost incredibly AGAIN in the final by the SAME score of 5-4 to

      <br>
      <big>The biggest headline that Big Brother has made has been due
to racism.
As the houseguests in the game are being recorded at all times for a
long period of time, some houseguests would be caught saying racist
remarks towards other houseguests. This epidemic mainly started in
Season 15 with houseguest Aaryn Gries, a young college student who lost
her job and college education due to several racist things she said on
the show. Ever since then, racism has been picked up on in previous and
future seasons, leaving the concern if racism is still a vital issue in
today's society. See the interview with Aaryn and visit the first
global webpage on the subject. <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/big-brother-contestants-lose-jobs-due-racist-homophobic-remarks-4B11210469">Article
from Big Brother 15.</a></big><br>
      <big><big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cheating/Adultery:</span></big></big><br>
      <big><br>
Another issue that has arised with the show is that once houseguests,
that already have a significant other, enter the house, there is an
immense amount of flirting in the house. This leads to some showmances
that end long-term relationships outside the house. This was especially
seen in Big Brother 16, where married Christine Varner flirted
intensely with young Cody Calafiore, this leaving viewers and the
husband angry as Christine was booed when she was evicted. This issue
occurs less in recent seasons, but can damage a houseguests life for
certain.</big><br>
